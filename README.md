useful links + started code on graph neural nets! 

Probably redundant but these are some great resources for graph paper links: 

1. [General papers](https://github.com/DeepGraphLearning/LiteratureDL4Graph)
2. [Primaryly recommendation stuff](https://github.com/yazdotai/graph-networks)
3. [Conference lists](https://github.com/naganandy/graph-based-deep-learning-literature)
